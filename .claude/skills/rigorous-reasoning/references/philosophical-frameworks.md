## Classical Logic (Aristotle)

### Fundamental Principles

**Three Laws of Thought:**

1. **Law of Identity**: A = A
   - Every thing is itself
   - Application: Definitions must remain consistent throughout an argument

2. **Law of Non-Contradiction**: ¬(A ∧ ¬A)
   - A statement cannot be both true and false at the same time
   - Application: Check internal consistency of arguments

3. **Law of Excluded Middle**: A ∨ ¬A
   - A statement is either true or false, with no third state
   - Note: Fuzzy logic extends this principle

### Syllogism

```
Major premise: All M are P     (All M are P)
Minor premise: S is M          (S is M)
─────────────────────────────
Conclusion: S is P             (Therefore, S is P)
```

**Valid Syllogistic Forms:**
- Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio (Figure 1)
- Cesare, Camestres, Festino, Baroco (Figure 2)
- Darapti, Disamis, Datisi, Felapton, Bocardo, Ferison (Figure 3)
- Bramantip, Camenes, Dimaris, Fesapo, Fresison (Figure 4)

## Rationalism

### Representatives: Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz

### Core Principles

**Cogito ergo sum** (I think, therefore I am)

**Method of Systematic Doubt:**
1. Accept only what is clear and distinct
2. Divide problems into manageable parts
3. Proceed from simple to complex
4. Review comprehensively to ensure nothing is omitted

### Application in Reasoning

- **Innate ideas**: Some concepts don't require experience (arithmetic, logic)
- **A priori reasoning**: Knowledge independent of experience
- **Logical necessity**: Conclusions are true if they follow logical rules

---

## Empiricism

### Representatives: Locke, Berkeley, Hume

### Core Principles

**Tabula rasa** (Blank slate) - The mind is initially empty

**Sources of Knowledge:**
1. **Sensation**: External sensory experience
2. **Reflection**: Observation of internal mental activity

### Hume's Critiques

**Problem of Induction:**
- Cannot logically prove that the future will resemble the past
- Induction relies on habit, not pure logic

**Problem of Causation:**
- We only observe succession, not necessity
- "Correlation is not causation" originates here

### Application in Reasoning

- Require empirical evidence
- Be skeptical of unverifiable claims
- Distinguish between observation and inference

---

## Critical Philosophy (Kant)

### Synthesis of Rationalism and Empiricism

**Types of Judgments:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Analytic a priori** | Predicate contained in subject, no experience needed | "A square has 4 sides" |
| **Synthetic a posteriori** | Predicate not in subject, requires experience | "This table is brown" |
| **Synthetic a priori** | Extends knowledge, no experience needed | "7 + 5 = 12" (Kant) |

### Conditions of Possibility

**Kant's Question:** What makes knowledge possible?

- **Forms of intuition**: Space, time
- **Categories of understanding**: Causality, substance, etc.
- **Ideas of reason**: World, soul, God

### Application in Reasoning

- Distinguish phenomena (appearance) from noumena (thing-in-itself)
- Recognize limits of reason
- Avoid antinomies (irresolvable contradictions)

---

## Logical Positivism

### Representatives: Vienna Circle (Carnap, Schlick, Neurath)

### Verification Principle

> A proposition is meaningful only if it can be verified by experience or is a logical tautology.

**Classification of Propositions:**
1. **Analytic propositions**: True by definition (logic, mathematics)
2. **Synthetic propositions**: Empirically verifiable
3. **Meaningless propositions**: Neither of the above (traditional metaphysics)

### Application in Reasoning

- Eliminate unverifiable claims
- Focus on precise language
- Logical analysis of concepts

---

## Philosophy of Science (Karl Popper)

### Counter-thesis: Falsificationism

> A theory is scientific only if it can be refuted by observation.

**Comparison with Verification:**

| Verification | Falsification |
|--------------|---------------|
| Seeks supporting evidence | Seeks to refute |
| Never proves completely | One counterexample suffices to refute |
| Prone to confirmation bias | Promotes critical thinking |

### Scientific Progress

```
Problem₁ → Hypothesis → Falsification test → Error elimination → Problem₂
```

**Verisimilitude**: New theories are closer to truth than old ones

### Application in Reasoning

- Always ask: "What would disprove this claim?"
- Prefer testable theories
- Accept the provisional nature of knowledge

---

## Dialectical Method

### Origins: Hegel, Marx

### Dialectical Triad

```
THESIS
    ↓
ANTITHESIS - Contradicts thesis
    ↓
SYNTHESIS - Transcends and preserves both
```

### Laws of Dialectics

1. **Unity and Struggle of Opposites**
   - Contradiction is the driving force of development

2. **Transformation of Quantity into Quality**
   - Sufficient quantitative accumulation → qualitative leap

3. **Negation of the Negation**
   - Development follows a spiral, returning at a higher level

### Application in Reasoning

- Seek internal contradictions in concepts
- View opposing arguments as part of development
- Avoid rigid binary thinking

---

## Pragmatism

### Representatives: Peirce, James, Dewey

### Pragmatic Principle

> The meaning of a concept lies in its practical consequences.

**William James:**
> "Truth is what works"

**John Dewey - Problem-Solving Method:**
1. Identify the problem
2. Propose hypotheses
3. Deduce consequences
4. Test through action
5. Evaluate results

### Application in Reasoning

- Evaluate arguments by practical consequences
- Avoid purely verbal disputes
- Flexibly adjust views based on results

- [ ] Is there empirical evidence?
- [ ] Is correlation confused with causation?

**From Critical Philosophy:**
- [ ] Does it exceed the limits of reason?
- [ ] Is there distinction between phenomena and noumena?

**From Logical Positivism:**
- [ ] Can the claim be verified?
- [ ] Is the language precise?

**From Popper:**
- [ ] Can the claim be falsified?
- [ ] Have counterexamples been sought?

**From Dialectics:**
